# LJ Code 201 - Day 11

Today was a full lab day - the first one we have had. We started off on Javascipt Git math questions, which were challenging (especially number 3). It was the first time I had really been involved in a co-working environment at Code Fellows. I asked for help on a few items and even helped a few people through issues they were having! I am really loving the collaborative nature of this class. 

Next, we had a Power Hour where Rachel hosted a Q&A with two female graduates of the program. I learned a ton and am a bit more familiar with the post-gradute flow. It's not unexpected to apply to 200-300 jobs the first time around, which seems amazing. I learned the importance of keeping your Git Hub account up to date and making daily commits to show that you are actively working projects. Super helpful advice! 

The third part of the day was continuing to work on our Salmon Cookies project. I am really happy with where I left off on it - everything seems to be working and I even got the calculations added to the page through DOM manipulation. I honestly cannot believe I came up with the code. I was looking back at the work and was kind of in awe. I am excited for the third week to begin!
