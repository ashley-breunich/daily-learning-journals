# LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Tonight we focused on Object Literals and DOMs. An Object Literal is the most popular way to create an object. It allows you to store data and access that data. Key value pairs are located inside the object and you can have as many items in the object that you wish. They can include any data type, including functions. 

ie (this is a value key pair): 
var wolf {
name: "Gray",
}

We spoke a bit about bracket notation [] to refer to the content you are wanting to access, however, dot notation is more common. 

I feel pretty good about Object Literals. The structure makes sense and I am actually pretty excited to start using them! 

We also discussed DOMs (Document Object Models). This concept was a bit more confusing to me but I think I get the gist of it. Each page (or document) has a unique DOM tree, which is how the elements are nested in one another. It's a visual representation of how each element on the page is related (parent, child, or sibling). The <html> tag is the root element and everything in between is nested inside in some way. 

We talked about "getting and setting." Through DOM manipulation, you are able to both get values of an element and set values of an element. 

### Tools
I want to look into repl.it and codepen.io - Both great "console-like" tools
