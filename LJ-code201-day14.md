# LJ Code 201 - Day 14

**May 23rd, 2018**
Today we did a lengthy code review on turning our object literals into constructor functions. It clarified a lot of questions for me - especially manipulating the DOM to create a chart. After I finish this journal, I am going to work on updating my own code.

We also discussed forms and events. This concept is still taking some time for me to understand. The events are not clicking yet. I hope that once I start playing around with the JavaScript, things start making sense.  

The one thing I am really excited for is designing the chart once I get the functionality working. I really enjoy experimenting with the CSS to make my products more aesthetically pleasing.
