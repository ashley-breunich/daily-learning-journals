# LJ Code 201 - Day 16

**May 26th, 2018**
I just finished a full day of lab and got a ton done. I worked on my form last night, as I wanted to get as much of that finished as I could before today. As of this morning, I was still having trouble rendering my "totals" footer in my cookie stands table but one of the TAs (Khalid) helped me get it working. I think we came up with a round-about solution, but it summed the totals so I am happy about that! I asked Tim to give me some feedback on a more succint way of combining the arrays as I know the answer is right in front of me. 

For the rest of the day, I focused on my CSS. I got it to a really good place but then realized I forgot to add the reset.css file. Once I did that, a lot of my formatting was removed so I had to make more adjustments. I definitely won't forget to add that file at the beginning of my project again - super annoying!

I took a break during the middle of the day to grab lunch with Hollie, Hannah, and Jamilla. It was really nice getting to know them all better. 

Looking forward to week 4!
