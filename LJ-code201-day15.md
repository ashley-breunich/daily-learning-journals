# LJ Code 201 - Day 15

**May 24th, 2018**
Today was the second co-working evening of the week. I got a lot of work done on my construtor functions (finalizing them and getting the header row to populate) and was able to send my resume over to my two accountability partners for review. They both gave great feedback that helped fine tune my resume a lot.  

A few things I am confused on:
1. How to add the rows of the shops to the page
2. How to sum up each location column
